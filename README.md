MusicApp is a modern Android application designed to deliver a seamless music experience using Jetpack Compose for a stunning, declarative UI and an API integration for fetching real-time music data. The app provides users with a curated list of top tracks, complete with artist details and album art.

Features:
Jetpack Compose UI:
A completely declarative approach for building user interfaces with highly interactive and visually appealing designs.
Components like LazyColumn, Row, and Image are utilized to render a list of top tracks dynamically.
Real-time Data with APIs:
The app fetches data from a music API (e.g., Last.fm or Spotify API) using an API key for secure and authenticated access.
Tracks, artist information, and album art are seamlessly displayed in the app.
Modular Architecture:
The app follows a clean architecture with separate layers for UI, data, and business logic, ensuring scalability and maintainability.
MusicViewModel handles the API response, providing live data to the composables for real-time updates.
Dynamic Content Rendering:
Images are loaded asynchronously using Coil, a popular image loading library for Jetpack Compose, ensuring smooth scrolling and memory efficiency.
Error handling ensures fallback messages or placeholders are displayed when data is unavailable.
Customizable Layouts:
Responsive design with adaptable layouts that provide an optimal viewing experience across different screen sizes.
Secure API Integration:
The API key is securely managed to prevent unauthorized usage, adhering to best practices like obfuscation or storing keys in the Android secrets.properties file.
Example Workflow:
Home Screen: A list of top tracks is displayed with their names, artist details, and album art in a card layout.
Track Details: Users can tap on a track to explore additional details like lyrics, album information, and streaming links.
Search Functionality: Users can search for their favorite artists or tracks.
Technologies Used:
Jetpack Compose: For building the UI.
Coil: For efficient image loading.
Retrofit/Moshi: For API communication and JSON parsing.
ViewModel + LiveData/StateFlow: For managing state and ensuring reactive updates to the UI.
